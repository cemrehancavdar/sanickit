Sanic-kit is a framework that applies some of the ideas of Svelte-kit to the Sanic web framework. In particular:

* File-path routing
* Easy deployment

The framework is designed for multi-page apps - pages are rendered on the server and sent to the browser. Libraries such as [htmx](https://htmx.org)
can be used to create a more SPA-like experience.
